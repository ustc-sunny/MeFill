{"pred": "\n\nA new species of theropod dinosaur, Caihong juji, has been discovered in northeastern China. It lived 160 million years ago during the Jurassic period. The fossilized remains show that Caihong had iridescent feathers on its head, chest, and parts of its tail, similar to those of hummingbirds. The feathers were long, flat, and organized into sheets, indicating that they may have given the dinosaur a rainbow glimmer. Scientists analyzed the nanostructures in the fossilized feathers and found that they were most similar to those of hummingbirds. The discovery suggests that feathers evolved for display before taking on the traits needed for flight. The iridescent feathers may have been used for social or sexual displays, as they are in modern birds. The discovery of Caihong provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and their role in dinosaur behavior. The fossilized feathers also show that Caihong had a frond-like tail with asymmetrical feathers, which may have been used for aerodynamics during gliding. Further study is needed to determine the functions of the iridescent feathers and tail.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

{"pred": "\nCongress is working through the weekend to avoid a government shutdown next week. The House voted early Sunday morning to fund federal agencies through December 15 with conditions related to the Affordable Care Act, including delaying the start of the law for one year and repealing the law's tax on medical devices. Senate Democrats say they will reject any changes to the health law, and President Obama would veto such a bill. House Speaker John Boehner has a strong incentive to continue fighting against the health law to appease conservative Republicans in his party. The Senate is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday afternoon, and Democrats could pass a bill to delay the health law and repeal the medical device tax with a 51-vote majority. Republicans argue that their proposal to delay the health care law for a year represents a compromise between their earlier efforts to repeal it entirely and Democrats' desire to make no changes in it for now. The window is closing on the opportunities for avoiding a government shutdown, and the House and Senate could agree to a compromise or pass a short-term funding bill to buy more time. A partial government shutdown could occur if an agreement is not reached, which would ratchet up pressure on both parties to reach a compromise. The Washington region, home to the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors, could lose an estimated $200 million a day and see over 70,000 jobs affected if the government shuts down. The economic impact could be significant, with cuts in federal services, including no new benefits applications, loans, or research funding. The shutdown would also affect national parks, museums, and other attractions. Democrats are pushing a hardline strategy to make Republicans cave, while Republicans are seeking to shift blame onto Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. The shutdown could have significant economic and political impacts, particularly for the Washington region.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission will travel closer to the sun than any previous probe, within 3.7 million miles of the surface. The Parker Solar Probe will study the sun's electric and magnetic fields, take photos of solar structure, and study the solar wind. The mission aims to answer questions about how the solar wind is accelerated and why the sun's outer atmosphere is hotter than its surface. The findings will help improve space weather forecasting and protect satellites and astronauts from solar radiation. The Parker Solar Probe will carry a chip with photos of Parker and his paper, as well as a plate carrying his inscription. The mission is named after Parker while he is still alive, a first for NASA. The Parker Solar Probe will travel to within 9 solar radii of the sun, seven times closer than any previous probe. The mission will take seven flybys of Venus to shrink its orbit around the sun over nearly seven years.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease over five years, found that those with the largest weight fluctuations had a 78% higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 17% higher risk of heart attack, a 136% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those with the smallest weight fluctuations.

The study's lead author notes that while the findings do not prove cause-and-effect, they raise concerns about the impact of weight fluctuations on heart health and suggest the need for further investigation. Previous studies have also linked yo-yo dieting to poor heart health.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

The study analyzed data from over 258,000 patients and found that 37,847 of them, or about 15%, were diagnosed before age 50. Younger patients were more likely to have advanced stage cancer, but lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to more aggressive treatment. The researchers suggest that this raises questions about whether screening guidelines should be altered to reflect the trend of younger patients being diagnosed with colorectal cancer. The study also found that younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with symptoms such as anemia, bowel bleeding or a blockage in the colon, which can be warning signs of cancer. Doctors should be on the lookout for these signs, especially in people with a family history of colon cancer or other risk factors. While the reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults are unknown, smoking, obesity and a poor diet are potential contributors.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The presence of dark energy is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate, which means that stars beyond our local group will become inaccessible in the future. Any advanced civilization would attempt to harvest stars from other galaxies before they become inaccessible, by capturing them with giant nets or satellites. This could be detected through unusual light signatures in the spectra of galaxies. Currently, humans are at Level I of the Kardashev scale, but some scientists believe there may be civilizations thousands or millions of years older that are already harvesting stars. The detection of such light signatures could indicate the presence of advanced alien civilizations.\n\nScience fiction authors have also proposed the idea of Dyson spheres, which are swarms of satellites that orbit a star to harness its energy. These structures would be too large to be built on a planet, so they would be made up of millions of individual satellites. Dyson spheres have been featured in science fiction works like \"Star Maker\" and \"Ringworld.\"\n\nIn summary, the paper suggests that harvesting energy from distant stars is not only a means of resource expansion, but also a means of survival for advanced civilizations in the expanding universe.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

The ears were designed to match the shape of his mother's ears. The surgery was primarily cosmetic but has already improved Kieran's confidence. Kieran can already hear thanks to previous surgery and a hearing aid but wanted to look like his friends.

Gibson denies the allegations, saying it has complied with U.S. and Malagasy law. The Environmental Investigation Agency has concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood. The Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees.\n\nIn other news, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996.

NPR aired the complicated story involving the 100-year old Lacey Act, which prohibits imports of endangered species, including plants, into the US. No formal charges have been pressed, but it appears the issue lies with Gibson possibly importing banned Madagascar ebony. Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer. Raising the octave even higher, it is possible Michelle Obama ran afoul of the Lacey Act when she presented France's Carla Bruni with a Gibson guitar that may have contained banned wood. However the story plays out, many are frustrated with the retroactive aspect of the law. \"It's a nightmare,\" says a dealer. \"I can't help it if they used Brazilian rosewood on almost every guitar made prior to 1970.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 1352}

The study used infrared telescopes to measure the isotopic composition of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, finding that the planet had a higher concentration of deuterium, a heavy form of hydrogen, than Earth. This indicates that Mars lost a significant amount of water in the past, with the researchers estimating that it would have been enough to create a global ocean that was around 137 meters deep. The study also suggests that the ocean was likely located in the northern hemisphere, where the altitude is lower. The findings provide further evidence that Mars was once habitable and could have supported life.\n\nThe study builds on previous research that showed Mars had a wetter past, with evidence of ancient rivers, lakes, and deltas. The new study provides more details on the extent of the ocean and how it would have looked. The researchers used data from three of the world's most powerful telescopes to make maps of the Martian atmosphere over six years, analyzing how different forms of water molecules varied in different locations and seasons.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with the idea that Mars was once a warm and wet world, with liquid water covering much of its surface.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises. Not in an ideal viewing area? The Virtual Telescope plans to livestream the total eclipse from Australia, which you can watch here, per Quartz.

The final stage of the vote covers nine provinces including the North and South Sinai governorates. Islamist groups are expected to consolidate their gains, with the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party taking the lead ahead of the more conservative Nour party. The election and Mubarak's trial take place amid growing opposition to the ruling generals, who say they won't cede power before presidential elections are held by the end of June. Clashes in Cairo last month between security forces and demonstrators calling for an earlier end to military rule left at least 17 dead. Economic growth has slowed as the unrest deters tourists and investors. Foreign-currency reserves declined by 4 percent to $20.2 billion in the first 1 months of 2011. About 14 million voters are eligible to vote in this round, and 150 parliamentary seats are up for grabs. In Minya, one of the provinces where balloting is being held today, Mina Magdy, a Christian, said gains by Islamists in previous rounds encouraged him to vote for the secular Egyptian Bloc alliance. The court trying Mubarak adjourned until tomorrow. Prosecutors argued that Mubarak was a \"tyrant\" who sought to install his son, Gamal, in his place, and allowed former Interior Minister Habib el-Adli to \"practice oppression and violence against Egyptians so he could remain in office.\" Mubarak faces charges of complicity in the killing of over 80 protesters during the 18-day uprising that forced him out of office.
